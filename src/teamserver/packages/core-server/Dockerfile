# This is the Dockerfile for the core-server which runs a Loco API server that handles 
# 1) User + Agent/Implant Authentication
# 2) Database interactions (Read/Write, etc lol)
# The core-server Loco.rs application runs within a hardened, and secured Debian 12 slim environment
# it aims to have minimal attack surface while providing the utilities to interact with the API server
FROM debian-slim:bullseye # TODO: LOL is this ever right???
